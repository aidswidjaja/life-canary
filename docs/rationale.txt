Why?

Because, like you, I'm still human. I have feelings and emotions, relations and connections. And ultimately, like every other human, I can be ended by death.

Throughout my time online, I've had the pleasure of meeting so many people and having so many great experiences. There's also plenty of real life people who might have moved away, or rely on online communication to stay in touch. If something were to happen to me, these people deserve to know, even if we didn't communicate as much anymore.
 
As I mentioned before, I have feelings and emotions. If some day, these emotions turned against me, then people should know. As mentioned before, I can be easily ended by death. If a catastrophic accident, or "accident" were to occur, then people should know. 

As long as the PGP-signed message gets updated each month, I'm still alive. And if not, then either I died, or something inside me died.

It might seem slightly self-centric to assume people online, or offline, would care if I disappear. But my focus is to make it so they don't have to worry. I wouldn't want people to worry about me, because hopefully, I would still demonstrably be alive.

The connections and relationships I've made online and offline are really special. If the connection comes to an end because of something that happened to me, then the right thing to do would be to make sure people know the connection has ended. I don't really feel like leaving people hanging.
